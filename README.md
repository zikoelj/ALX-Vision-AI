# webstack-Portfolio-Project
My project is a web application that detects objects in images using deep learning techniques.
To use this web application, you need to install the necessary packages and dependencies. First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory. It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Once your virtual environment is set up, you can install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt if a requirements.txt file is provided. This will ensure that all necessary libraries are installed for the application to function correctly. After the installation, you can start the application and access it through your web browser.
